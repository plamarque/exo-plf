Description: Friend Suggestion is gadget that allow to display a list of contacts that current user maybe know.

How to use:
   - Click to "Invite +" to send invitation to suggested friend.
   - If you want to hide suggested friend from list then click on (x) icon.

Limitation:
   - Code need to improve and it can merge 2 groovy files to one call "FriendSuggestionService.groovy".
   - Add more criterions to find "suggested friends" instead "mutual friends" only.
   - The UI to display the suggested friends (maybe limit 2 or 3 item displayed).
