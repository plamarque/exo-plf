How to manually install eXo Platform 3 for JBoss EPPSP ?
********************************************************

1/ Extract the eXo Platform for JBoss EPPSP package

First, you should extract the file eXoPlatform-for-eppsp-x.y.z.zip on your computer. We will refer to the newly created folder with the $plf-home variable in this guide.

You should get a structure as follows:
eXoPlatform-for-eppsp-x.y.z/
    * INSTALL.txt           - this file
    * addons/               - a folder that contains the main addons files
          o binaries/       - the EARs files
          o conf/           - the configuration needed to make the addons work
    * demos/                - a folder that contains demos of eXo Platform, these are not supported
          o binaries/       - the EARs files of the demos
    * docs                  - the eXo Platform Addons documentations
          
          
2/ Copy the Platform apps

Copy the content of $plf-home/addons/binaries into $eppsp-home/server/default/deploy.
These files will be copied:
    * exo.cs.extension.ear
    * exo.ks.extension.ear
    * exo.platform.extension.ear
    * exo.social.extension.ear
    * exo-ecms-packaging-workflow.ear
    
And copy the content of $plf-home/addons/demos/binaries into $eppsp-home/server/default/deploy.
These files will be copied:
    * exo.platform.office.ear                  - a social intranet with knowledge management and collaborative work features
    * exo.platform.sample.acme-website.ear     - a full corporate website featuring the power of EPP Site Publisher
    * exo.platform.sample.default-website.ear  - the landing page with some general information
    * docs.war                                 - the webapp that contains the docs, to browse within JBoss
    
3/ Configure the server

To make the addons work, you need to configure a few things. First, copy the content of $plf-home/addons/conf/bin into $eppsp-home/bin:
    * run.conf
    * run.bat
    * exokey.pem
    * oauthkey.pem

And copy the content of $plf-home/addons/conf/server/default/conf/gatein into $eppsp-home/server/default/conf/gatein
    * configuration.xml

Now, you have to add only last part of the configuration file $plf-home/addons/conf/configuration.properties 
into your existing configuration.properties file: $eppsp-home/server/default/conf/gatein/configuration.properties.

# OTHER #

# Chat Server  #

If you have existing Java options, make sure to merge them with ours (run.conf or run.bat).
To work correctly, eXo Platform 3 needs the following system variables:
    * -Dexo.profiles=default             - to start the default addons and demos
    * -Dexo.product.developing=false     - to disable the developer mode, better for production
    * -Dexo.conf.dir.name=gatein         - the path to the configuration folder
    * -Dgatein.data.dir=../gatein        - the path to store eXo Platform's data

Finally, activate the SSO in $eppsp-home/server/default/deploy/jbossweb.sar/server.xml.
Simply uncomment the block <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn" />
You can look at $plf-home/addons/conf/server/default/deploy/jbossweb.sar/server.xml for an example (line 105).
