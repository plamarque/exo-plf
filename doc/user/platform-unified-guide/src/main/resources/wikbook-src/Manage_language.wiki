In eXo Platform, the priority order of the display language decreases to the arrow direction from left to right: 

*User's language --> Cookies' language --> Session's language --> Browser's language --> Portal's language*

It means that the language set by the user will be at the highest level, and the portal's language at the lowest level.  

Accordingly, you should pay attention to this order when selecting your preferred display language.
