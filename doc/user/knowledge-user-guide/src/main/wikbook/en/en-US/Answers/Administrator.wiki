By not using Ajax, the Answers will generate plain URLs in the links. The added benefit will be bookmarkability and better SEO as the links will be permalinks.
Using Ajax, the links will be javascript-based and generate Ajax calls. This should make browsing faster because the whole page is not reloaded.
