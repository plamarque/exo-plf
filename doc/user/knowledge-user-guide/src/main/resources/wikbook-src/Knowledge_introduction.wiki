*Answers and FAQs*

*Answers* is a collaborative Question & Answer system similar to Yahoo! Answers or StackOverflow.com but for your own enterprise, where the collaboration is encouraged. 
With this application, you and your collaborators can post a series of common questions and find answers on a specific topic. Here, you can edit questions, provide answers and edit them. 
*FAQs* takes this content as input and publishes it in a clean and quickly browsable manner. You can point a *FAQs* portlet to one or several *Answers* categories. As a publishing portlet, it is impossible to edit questions and answers in *FAQs*.

*Forum*

*Forum* is designed for the group discussion and user-generated content in which participants with common interests can exchange their opinions on a subject.
While *Answers* is an ideal site for you to find answers quickly, *Forum* gives deep discussion through your posted topics.

*Wiki*

*Wiki* is an enterprise wiki application focused on content productivity for portal users as a tool to forge the unstructured knowledge. *Wiki* allows you to create and edit pages by using a simplified markup language or a WYSIWYG editor.
With this application, your company can use *Wiki* as an internal reference, such as work policy, or a public wiki for a comprehensive product information. *Wiki* along with *Answers* and *Forum* will 
complete the ideal combination that helps users enhance their experiences on collaboration activities and build valuable knowledge center for clients.

h1. About user roles  {anchor:id=KSuser.about_role}

Please note that each user group has different privileges to perform actions. Some actions can be limited to some specific user groups. Advanced users have the ability to control and assign functions or features that other users can and cannot do within the application. There are four user groups: administrator, moderator, regular user and guest.

* *Administrator* is an advanced user, who typically has the highest right when using Knowledge. The Administrator can manage user privileges and he has rights to perform all possible capabilities. For example, in Forum, an administrator can create categories, close/delete, lock/unlock forums; promote a regular user to moderator or create a category that is restricted to a specific user group.

* *Moderator* obtains a subset of administrator's rights. It means that he has certain allowed capabilities and may perform these advanced actions in a specific area only. For example, a moderator of a category in Forum can only perform advanced actions in the category that he is assigned as the moderator. The moderator role is assigned by the administrator.

* *Regular user* is defined as a logged-in user who can only use the basic features of Knowledge. The regular user can be promoted to the advanced user by the administrator.

* *Guest* (anonymous user) is an unregistered/unlogged-in user who is often limited to a very few features only of Knowledge. For instance, a guest can view topics in Forum but he cannot reply or create new topics.

Notice that there will be no section dedicated to anonymous users. For the actions that an anonymous user can perform, you can refer to the table that summarizes all the actions in each application.
