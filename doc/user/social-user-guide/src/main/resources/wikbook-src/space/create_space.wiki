The concept "team work" becomes very familiar in business environment. By establishing one specific team or group, you and your collaborators can work together on important projects. Based on the importance of team working, eXo Platform develops the
*Space* application, allowing you to collaborate with specific people. This means that if you want to work on a team project, you can create a space for your team members to make organizations, share links and information related to the project.

To access a space, click *My Spaces* on the *Administration* bar.

* *Visibility*: By default, the *Visibility* value is set to be *Visible*. {anchor:id="visibility"}
** Visible:{anchor:id="visible_space"} The space is always visible in the public spaces list.
** Hidden:{anchor:id="hidden_space"} The space is not visible in the public spaces list.
* *Registration*: By default, the *Registration* value is set as *Validation*.
** Open: The users sending their requests can join the space without any validation.
** Validation: The membership must be validated by the space manager.
** Close: The user cannot request for joining, but only the space manager can invite him.

One of the two following cases occurs when you select this tab.

* *The first instance*: You have been already the manager of a group. It means that you have created at least a space.
