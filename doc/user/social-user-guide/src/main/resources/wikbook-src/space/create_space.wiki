The concept "team work" becomes very familiar in business environments. By establishing one specific team or group, you and your collaborators can work together on important projects. Based on the importance of team working, eXo Platform develops the
*Space* application, allowing you to collaborate with specific people. This means that if you want to work on a team project, you can create a space for your team members to make organizations, share links and information related to the project.

To access a space, click *My Spaces* on the *Administration bar*.

The *My Spaces* page appears as below.

The *Space navigation* includes the following tabs:  {anchor: id="space_navigation"}

* *All Spaces:* all spaces which have been created with the Visibility value as Visible.
* *My Spaces*: spaces where you have the role as a member or a manager. 
* *Received Invitations*: spaces where you are invited to become members by space managers.
* *Pending Requests*: spaces where you have requested to become their members.

* *Visibility*: By default, the *Visibility* value is set to be *Visible*.
** Visible: The space is always visible in the public spaces list.
** Hidden: The space is not visible in the public spaces list.
* *Registration*: By default, the *Registration* value is set as *Validation*. There will be an explanation text (within two round brackets) corresponding to each your selection. 
** Open: The users sending their requests can join the space without any validation.
** Validation: The membership must be validated by the space manager.
** Close: The user cannot request for joining, but only the space manager can invite him.

*4.* Select all members of a specific group for your space where you are already 'manager' in the *Invite users from group* tab.

One of the two following cases occurs when you select this tab.

* *The first instance*: You have been already the manager of a group. It means that you have created at least a space. 

The *Invite users from group* tab will be displayed as below.

After you have selected one existing group, all users in that group will be invited to join your newly created space.

* *The second instance*: You have not been a manager of any group yet. It means that this is the first time you create a space, so you cannot select a target group.
