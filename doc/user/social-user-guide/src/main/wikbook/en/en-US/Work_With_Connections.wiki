h1. Search for your contact {anchor:id=search_contacts}

To find your desired contact quickly, use the *Search* function. To search for contacts, do as follows:

*1.* Select the relevant tab in which you want to do your searches.

* To search across all users in eXo Social, select the *People* tab.

* To reduce the returned search results, select the appropriate tab first before using the search box. For example, to search for contacts with whom you have established connections, you need to select the *Network* tab first. 

*2.* Enter the contact name you want to search into the *Find contact* field. When you type, the application automatically suggests the contact name containing your entered letter. You just need to select one of suggested names from the drop-down list.
