* A user without the read permission cannot see the address book.

* A user with the management permission is allowed to edit/rename and manage permissions on the address book.

By default, any member of a group has the read permission. The manager has the management permission on the group. Only the creator of a public address book can grant permission.

*Grant a permission on an address book*

*1.* Right-click your public address book and select *Permission* from the drop-down menu.

The *Permissions* form appears.

*2.* Now you can start selecting certain users or groups to grant the permissions. Simply click !images/user_selector_icon.png! to select a user, or click !images/group_selector_icon.png! to select a group. The respective *User Selector* or *Group Selector* form will appear. Now, you have to select a user or group of users to grant the permission. The process is similar with [Share an address book|#CSUser_guide.How_to_use_Address_book.Share_an_address_book].

Select the *'Can manage?'* checkbox if you would like to grant the management permission to the selected users/group.
