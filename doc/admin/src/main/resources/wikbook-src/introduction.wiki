The foundation of eXo Platform 3.5 is an enterprise portal and content management system. This provides a powerful set of REST-based services for rapid website development, content management and gadget-based development and deployment. eXo Platform 3.5 includes the following features.

* An enterprise portal serves as a powerful framework for developing portlets and other web-based user interfaces, and is based on the open source GateIn portal project co-developed by eXo and Red Hat.
* Web Content Management extends portal-based applications, allowing you to build dynamic and content-rich websites.
* Document Management for capturing and organizing documents and unstructured content, with content storage in the built-in Java Content Repository (JCR). 
* xCMIS is an implementation of the full stack of Java-based CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Specification) services, so eXo-based applications can integrate with existing content management tools.
* Business Process Management (BPM) from Bonita Open Solution enables you to define workflow processes with automatic actions for web content, documents and more.
* Cloud-ready features allow eXo Platform 3.5 to run in multi-tenant environments, so social intranets and websites can take advantage of the benefits of private and public cloud platforms.

With eXo Platform 3.5, you can customize and extend your portal-based applications with user experience services to  build social intranets and extranets.
* Enterprise social network features allow users to connect, collaborate within dedicated spaces, and publish real-time updates in activity streams. Support for OpenSocial provides a framework for building gadgets that can display and mash up activity information for contacts, social networks, applications and services.
* Collaboration & communication tools let you build a more productive and interactive dashboard for social intranet users. Intuitive Mail, Chat, Calendar and Address Book functionalities can seamlessly extend your portal-based web applications.
* Knowledge management features, including Forums, Answers, FAQs, and a complete enterprise wiki, can transform an extranet into an interactive online community and valuable knowledge base.
* Custom development in the web-based IDE is an intuitive web-based development environment where you can build, test and deploy client applications, such as gadgets and mash-ups, and RESTful services online. Offering the ability to extend eXo Platform online, eXo IDE instantly publishes any application that you can create and deploy immediately in your portal-based solutions.
* CRaSH is an open source tool to view and query content within a JCR server at runtime. It enables you to browse JCR trees, and serves as a shell for executing JCR operations easily, such as importing or exporting data securely. You can now extend the shell by writing Groovy commands, without recompiling easily.
* Native mobile applications for iPhone, iPad and Android allow users to easily and securely access their personalized intranet dashboards, activity streams, documents and more.
