h1. Setup Wizzard

As a convenience we provide a setup wizzard UI that will generate all system configuration. 
But you can still make them by your own. The following paragraphs will detail manual configuration.

h1. Principles of Configuration

System configuration for eXo Platform is stored in a file named {{configuration.properties}}.
The location of this file varies depending on the AS :
* default bundle: {{$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/exo-configuration.properties}}
* JBoss : {{$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/exo-configuration.properties}}

h1. Database Configuration
eXo Platform relies on the application server for its database access. 
Therefore the database is configured at the application server level as a datasource. 
That datasource is obtained by performing access to the enterprise naming context (ENC) through the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) service.

h2. JBoss 
JBoss Application Server relies on deployment descriptors for its datasource management. 
Datasources are bound in the enterprise naming context with a {{java:}} prefix.
By default, eXo Platform defines two datasources 
* {{java:exojcr}} : for the Java Content Repository (JCR).
* {{java:exoidm}} : for the organizational model.

The file {{sample-confs/jboss/exo-ds.xml}} can be used to drop into the {{deploy/}} directory.
