eXo Platform comes packaged as a deployable enterprise archive as per the Java EE specification and a configuration directory.

h1. Runtime Considerations
eXo Platform requires a purposive infrastructure for its deployment and is certified on the following products:
* Sun Java 6 Virtual Machine 
* JBoss Application Server 5.1 
* Oracle version 9 and 10, MySQL version 5 and DB2 version 9 

For more details on the supported combinations, please refer to the [Supported Platforms Matrix].

h1. Installing the Tomcat bundle
The easiest way to install eXo Platform is simply to take the default bundle. 
It's a ready-made packaging on top of Tomcat 6 application server. Hence, the instructions are as simple as copying the ##exoplatform-tomcat/## directory to your server

	
h1. Installing the EAR distribution 

If you are already using another enterprise java application server, eXo Platform is available as a set of Enterprise Archive (EAR) files.
Although the EAR format is rather standardized, the JEE specifications leaves the details of deployment up to the each vendor.

Currently, this guide provide instructions for :
* JBoss 5.1 community
* JBoss EAP

If your application server is not covered, please contact eXo Support.
