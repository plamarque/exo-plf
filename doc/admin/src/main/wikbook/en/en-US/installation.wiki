eXo Platform is packaged as a deployable enterprise archive, per the Java EE specification, and as a configuration directory.


h1. Installing the Tomcat bundle
The easiest way to install eXo Platform is to take the default bundle. 
This is a ready-made package on top of Tomcat 6 application server, so you simply need to copy the {{bin/tomcat6-bundle/}} directory to your server.

h1. Startup


eXo Platform leverages the Application Server on which it is deployed. 
This means, to start and stop eXo Platform, you only need to start and stop your application with the default commands.

* On Linux/Unix:       {screen}$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/gatein.sh{screen}
* On Windows:          {screen}%TOMCAT_HOME%\\bin\\gatein.bat{screen}

The server has started when you see the following message in your log/console:
{screen}
INFO: Server startup in 353590 ms
{screen}

h1. Shutdown


* On Linux/Unix:   {screen}$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh{screen}
* On Windows:      {screen}%TOMCAT_HOME%\\bin\\shutdown.bat {screen}

The server has stopped when you see the following message in your log/console:

{screen}
INFO: Stopping Coyote HTTP/1.1 on http-8080
{screen}



h1. Other options

h2. Profiles
By passing {{-Dexo.profiles=p1,p2,p3...}}, you can enable modules.

You can enable/disable select modules if they are not in use. 
* {{collaboration}}: enables eXo Collaboration module
* {{knowledge}}: enables eXo Knowledge module
* {{social}}: enables eXo Social module
* {{dms}}: enables Document Management System add-on withn the eXo Content module
* {{workflow}}: enables the Workflow add-on within the eXo Content module

Additionally, you can use several predefined profiles: 
* (none): contains GateIn + WCM
* {{default}}: contains GateIn + WCM + Collaboration + Knowledge + Social + IDE
* {{all}}: all available modules, including DMS and Workflow

{note}Profiles are pluggable, so you can combine them together to shape eXo Platform to your needs. 
e.g : {{-Dexo.profiles=default,cmis}} will take the default profile and add CMIS server{note}



h2. JVM settings

eXo startup scripts come with the following basic JVM settings:
{screen}
-Xms256m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m 
{screen}

This is enough to start and run a demo, but you will need to adjust these values for a production setup.
