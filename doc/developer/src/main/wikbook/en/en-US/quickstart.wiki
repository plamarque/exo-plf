This guide will help developers use eXo Platform successfully for their projects. It introduces eXo architecture and gives step-by-step instructions for building your own custom portal based on eXo Platform.

{note}While this document covers the most common tasks used when developing on eXo Platform, it is not a complete reference document.
The full Reference Guide is available in the delivery package and is linked rather than replicated here.{note}


*Requirements:*
* JDK (Java Development Kit) 6.0 
* SVN 1.6+
* Maven 2.2.1+
* Tomcat 6.0.26 or JBoss 5.1.0

*Environment:*

Add a system environment variable MAVEN_OPTS (it could be in a .profile startup script on Linux/MacOS operating systems or in global environment variables panel on Windows).

* Windows:
{code}
set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xshare:auto -Xms128M -Xmx1G -XX:MaxPermSize=256M
{code}
* Linux/MacOS:
{code}
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xshare:auto -Xms128M -Xmx1G -XX:MaxPermSize=256M"
{code}


*Maven settings:*

Save the file {{settings.xml}} in {{HOME/.m2/settings.xml}}
http://wiki.exoplatform.org/xwiki/bin/download/Main/Building%20from%20sources/settings.xml

Edit and change the {{local-properties}} profile:
* {{exo.projects.directory.dependencies}} contains the application servers, and openfire
* each {{exo.projects.app.AS-NAME.version}} contains the name and version of the application servers

Note: If you have an existing file settings.xml, you can merge them all together. At the minimum, you will need the following:
- The local-properties profile, which defines the properties used to build application server distributions of our products 
- The repository [http://repository.exoplatform.org/public] to download our dependencies
