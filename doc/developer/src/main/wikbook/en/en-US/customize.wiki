h1. Creating your own portal

When working with eXo, you typically do not modify eXo binary files, but provide your own artefacts as a set of wars/jars/ears.
That's important for your further upgrades and for support.

h2. Quickstart

A custom extension contains typically two mandatory things : 
* extension webapp : contains resources and kernel configurations 
* extension activator jar : declares your webapp as a dependency of the portal container

Point to a sample provided with package (talk about the maven archetype when it's ready).
>> adapt gatein sample extension as a tutorial to illustrate overriding
