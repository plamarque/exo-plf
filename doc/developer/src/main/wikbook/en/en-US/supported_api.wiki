eXo Platform 3.0 comes with a set of APIs to help you build your own applications from eXo services.

h2. Definitions of API Levels

APIs vary according to level of maturity. It is important to understand the eXo's general approach to API change management.

The different levels of APIs are described in the following table:
|| API Level || Test Suite || Clients || Documentation || Support || Compatibility X.Y.Z(+1) || Compatibility X.Y(+1)
|*Platform API*| !yes.gif! | !yes.gif! | !yes.gif! | !yes.gif! | !yes.gif! | !yes.gif! |
|*Provisional API*| !yes.gif! | !yes.gif! | !yes.gif! | !yes.gif! | !yes.gif! | !no.gif! |
|*Experimental API*| !yes.gif! | !no.gif! | !yes.gif! | Best effort | Best effort | !no.gif! |
|*Unsupported API*| !no.gif! | !no.gif! | !no.gif! | !no.gif! | !no.gif! | !no.gif! |

*Test Suite*: A suite of tests that can be run against the API to detect changes.

*Clients*: The API has been used successfully by at least 2 different teams, using API Documentation only.

*Documentation*: The API has a clean JavaDoc and reference documentation.

*Support*: The eXo Support team provides help on the code that uses this API, and fixes any reported bugs.

*Compatibility X.Y.Z(+1)*: The compatibility between maintenance versions (X.Y.Z and X.Y.Z+1) is guaranteed. If a change appears between X.Y and X.Y+1, the eXo Support team will help by upgrading the code.

*Compatibility X.Y(+1)*: The compatibility between minor versions (X.Y and X.Y+1) is guaranteed. If a change appears between X and X+1, the eXo Support team will help by upgrading the code.

*Best Effort*: We will provide assistance, but eXo cannot guarantee any specific result.


h3. Using Provisional or Experimental APIs
These APIs are provided to give an "early look" at what will be available in upcoming versions of the eXo Platform. These APIs are not final, but they can be used to start developing your application.

*Provisional APIs* are APIs close to being frozen, but that need a last look from users. They can be used by third-party developers for their own apps, with the knowledge that only a limited compatibility guarantee is offered.

*Experimental APIs* are APIs that are likely to change. They are published in order to get feedback from the community. These APIs have been tested successfully, but have not yet had enough feedback from developers.
